     - original version
     - Data::Semantic::Base: is_valid_normalized_value() also requires the
       value to be well-formed
     - Data::Semantic::RegexpAdapter: is_valid_normalized_value() just calls
       is_well_formed() - is that right?
     - Data::Semantic::Test: now deals with TESTDATA instead of well_formed(),
       not_well_formed(), valid() and invalid()
     - updated MANIFEST
     - deleted lib/Data/Semantic/RegexpTest.pm
     - getting rid of the distinction between well-formedness and validity.
       Only validity remains
     - deleted lib/Data/Semantic.pm
     - moveed Data::Semantic::Base to Data::Semantic
     - deleted lib/Data/Semantic/Base.pm
     - started to add documentation
     - Data::Semantic::RegexpAddapter: keep() is now a boolean attribute
     - Data::Semantic::Test: added documentation
     - updated t/perlcriticrc
