NAME
    Data::Semantic - Common API for data with semantics attached to them

VERSION
    version 1.101620

DESCRIPTION
    There are various distributions on CPAN dealing with data that has
    semantics attached them. For example, an IP address is not just a
    string, but it has a format the can be checked.

    There is Data::Domain. It does not store the values to be tested, it
    just tests them and records messages.

    Then there is Class::Value. It does store the value and it records
    exceptions.

    Both share the same underlying concept of a value that can be tested for
    validity. Data::Semantic provides this underlying mechanism. It does not
    store the value and it does not record the message. All it does is
    validate data and say whether it is good or bad. What Data::Domain or
    Class::Value do with this information is their thing.

    If you have a new type of semantic data, here is how you can handle it.

        if it can be a Regexp::Common pattern:
            make a Regexp::Common pattern
            make a subclass of Data::Semantic::RegexpAdapter
        else:
            make a subclass of Data::Semantic::Base
            if there is a CPAN module for that data type:
                wrap that module in your semantic data class
                forward methods onto the object if possible

        make an adapter class for Class::Value
        make an adapter class for Data::Domain

METHODS
  new
        my $obj = Data::Semantic->new;
        my $obj = Data::Semantic->new(%args);

    Creates and returns a new object. The constructor will accept as
    arguments a list of pairs, from component name to initial value. For
    each pair, the named component is initialized by calling the method of
    the same name with the given value. If called with a single hash
    reference, it is dereferenced and its key/value pairs are set as
    described before.
